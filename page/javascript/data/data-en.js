        "profile": "I am a graduate with a masters in computer science currently working as a Software Engineer. I have always been passionate about technology, first graduating in 2012 with a degree in sound engineering and subsequently working for several world wide known recording studios. My passion for technology then led me to work for Apple Inc. which further drove me to explore computer programming as a career path. I have found that the combination of technical knowledge, logic, and creativity that programming requires is highly fulfilling and continues to fascinate me to this day. Given my dynamic and inquisitive nature, I could not see myself working in any other field. I have come to the realization that the diverse application of programming knows no bounds! I believe that technology has strong potential for bringing people together and stimulating human progress at a faster and more efficient pace than ever before",

My contributions mainly included the creation of Python Lambdas and Step Functions, IAC system design for a cross-service architecture, and the implementation of micro front-end functionalities using React. I have successfully navigated the intricacies of monitoring analytics with tools such as Datadog and AWS CloudWatch, further enhancing the security and efficiency of the platform. Finally, with the use of Helm and Kubernetes, I deployed and ensured no regressions on production environments on our release dates.\n\nPrior to my current role, I served as a Front-End VueJS Engineer at L’Oréal Paris, where I played a pivotal role in the development of multiple front-end applications within the L’Oréal EcoSystem. Notable achievements include refactoring and adapting the company's codebase to use the combination of BEM class syntax and Tailwind Technologies, implementing end-to-end tests with Cypress, leading the migration of our JavaScript codebase to TypeScript, and moving our SPAs to a dynamic monorepo using Lerna, enhancing our team's development experience. My role also involved the creation of front-end pages and active components, externalizing a core library using Storybook and Google Analytics 4 interactions, resolving XSS attacks across these applications, creating Azure pipelines with a release system that versioned our applications, and finally providing scaling possibilities by creating a cross-service custom CMS application that was used by our scaling team.\n\nAs a Full Stack JEE/React Engineer at SNCF, where our primary objective was calculating the intervals between train stops, I managed various applications to detect anomalies in our API's public transport flows. I led the creation of React modules for micro-frontends and studied and proposed a version upgrade from AngularJS to Angular 14, which included the transition to ECMAScript 6. I implemented a batch system alongside a caching system using Spring Boot and Redis on our back end. My expertise extended to the development of unit tests with JUnit, Dockerizing and deploying our application across a microservice infrastructure.\n\nAs a Spring Boot/Angular Developer, I contributed significantly to developing an energy transition support service program adopted by ADEME and funded by the French government. I actively participated in the evolution of its architecture, creation of full-stack features, bug resolutions, front-end development with Angular, and back-end development with Spring Boot. My role also involved data management and the design of data models using Postgres and Flyway.\n\nFurthermore, my entrepreneurial spirit led me to work as a Full Stack NodeJs/TypeScript Developer at Xotosphere, where I implemented a monorepo architecture with git submodules and Turbo, designed UX/UI models with Figma, and conducted micro front-end components using Vue 3 and Single spa technologies to develop multiple front-end frameworks in a single viewport. I also integrated the back-end development in NodeJS, Prisma as the primary application's ORM, and MongoDB as our NoSQL database. This project also included the development of reusable GitLab pipelines from an external repository. It involved 3D technologies using Blender to create 3D models and WebGL to integrate them into our application.\n\nDuring my internship at IMAIOS, an innovative medical imaging and e-learning company, I served as a full-stack JS Developer. As a vital member of a 7-person team in a SaaS company, I contributed to the development of new screens and graphic components in the GUI, employing technologies such as Angular2+, NodeJS, EJS, Typescript, Docker, NGRX, Jest, and OWASP with Cloudflare. Notably, I played a crucial role in optimizing systems using websockets via Javascript and integrating testing modules to facilitate the deployment process using Gost Inspector, Google Lighthouse, and other SEO metrics. I also took part in creating complex sorting algorithms, optimizing the goal to improve the application's performance.\n\nPrior to my years of experience working with multiple Agile-driven projects in SaaS companies listed above, my journey into the technology landscape began at Apple, where I served as a Software and Hardware Technician in the Greater Seattle Area. I established empowering communication experiences during my tenure, led product training and troubleshooting workshops, and assisted with data migration and multimedia workflow applications.\n\nIn addition to my professional experiences, I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from University College Dublin and have acquired a solid educational foundation in data science, extensive data programming, and contemporary software development. What draws me to your organization is the prospect of contributing my diverse skill set and aligning my passion for technology with your commitment to driving progress through innovative software engineering. The opportunity to be part of a dynamic team that shares my values of pushing technological boundaries and fostering a collaborative and creative work environment is immensely appealing. Moreover, I am particularly interested in your company's reputation for setting ambitious software engineering goals that resonate with my aspirations. The commitment to excellence and the pursuit of cutting-edge solutions align with my vision for contributing to projects that drive technological advancements on a global scale.\n\nIn conclusion, my journey from recording studios to multinational corporations in tech has equipped me with a unique blend of technical proficiency, adaptability, and a passion for pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve. I am excited about possibly contributing my skills and experiences to your esteemed organization and would welcome the opportunity to discuss further how I can bring value to your team. My commitment to maintaining clean code, enthusiasm for innovative microservice and dynamic monolith architectures, and proficiency in the latest technologies make me a valuable addition to your team.\n\nI look forward to discussing how my skills and experiences align with the program’s goals.",
